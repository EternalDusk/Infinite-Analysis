# Halo Infinite Stats Analysis

Simple GUI implementation to track stats of past Halo Infinite ranked crossplay games.

## Description

A random project idea I spent just under 10 total hours working on to complete. Using Autocode and HaloDotApi, you can now track your accuracy, K/D, and other statistics over your past 10 games, as well as see your past game history!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* lib
* Flask

### Installing

* From source:

```
git clone https://github.com/EternalDusk/Infinite-Analysis
cd Infinite-Analysis
```
Navigate to https://autocode.com/auth/, make a free account and get a General Use Identity Token (found under the Identity Tokens menu)

Open main.py, and under settings on line 21, replace <insert_token_here> with your token

* From release:

Simply download the exe under releases (also found at https://github.com/EternalDusk/Infinite-Analysis/releases )

### Executing program

* Run main.py or run release.exe

* Enter in the username you want to track

* Go to http://localhost:8080 to view your statistics (it may take a second to load)
